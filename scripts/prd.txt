# Overview
Design Feedback Web Application is a comprehensive platform built to streamline the design review and feedback process between designers and clients. The application solves the challenge of managing design iterations, collecting precise feedback, and maintaining clear communication throughout the design process. It's primarily designed for illustrators and designers who work with clients on various design projects, particularly focusing on illustrations, animated GIFs, and potentially video content.

The platform provides a structured approach to version control, feedback collection, and project management, making it easier for designers to manage multiple clients and projects while giving clients an intuitive interface for providing detailed feedback.

The application follows a minimal, modern design aesthetic with clear navigation and intuitive interfaces, ensuring both designers and clients can focus on the work without interface complexity getting in the way.
